            <h2 class="h2 mb-4 text-olympic-blue">The Story</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
                Michael Phelps wasn't just born to swim—he was born to dominate the water like no one before him.
                Growing up in Baltimore, Maryland, Phelps was introduced to swimming at the age of seven to channel his
                boundless energy and manage his ADHD. Little did the world know that this energetic kid would go on to
                become the most decorated Olympian of all time. His story is one of unparalleled dedication, unrelenting
                focus, and an insatiable hunger to push beyond limits.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Phelps' rise to greatness began early. By the age of 15, he had already qualified for his first Olympic
                Games in Sydney 2000, making him the youngest male swimmer to represent Team USA in 68 years. Though he
                didn&rsquo;t medal, it was just the beginning of a legendary career. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, Phelps
                won
                six gold medals and two bronze, signaling his arrival as a true powerhouse in the pool.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                However, it was the 2008 Beijing Olympics that cemented his legacy, where he achieved the unprecedented
                feat of winning eight gold medals in a single Games, breaking Mark Spitz's long-standing record. His
                performances were marked by sheer dominance, breathtaking finishes, and the now-iconic fingertip victory
                in the 100m butterfly. But his journey wasn&rsquo;t without obstacles—mental health struggles,
                relentless
                training schedules, and the pressure of living up to his own legacy challenged him at every step.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Phelps continued his reign in the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, adding more medals to his tally and
                further proving his versatility across multiple strokes and distances. Despite announcing his retirement
                multiple times, his love for the sport kept bringing him back to the water, each time with the same
                passion and intensity.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Beyond his physical prowess, Phelps' influence extends far beyond the pool. He has been an outspoken
                advocate for mental health awareness, sharing his own struggles with depression and anxiety to inspire
                others. Today, he continues to motivate aspiring swimmers and athletes worldwide, proving that true
                greatness is about perseverance, resilience, and never backing down from challenges.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                From an energetic kid with big dreams to the greatest Olympian in history, Michael Phelps' story is an
                enduring legacy of hard work, heart, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence.
